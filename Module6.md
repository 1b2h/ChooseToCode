##Module 6 - Intro to BootStrap

###Objectives
 - refactor existing website to use Bootstrap for layout

###Adding Bootstrap to our web site

In order to begin using Bootstrap on our web page, we need to include it in our web page. There are two pieces to the Bootstrap framework: Stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript (js). We could download these to our own working folder, but for now, we are going to use a Content Delivery Network to give us the version of Bootstrap we want.

We're going to add the two Bootstrap files to our \<head> tag in our web page like this:

````
<head>
	<title>My First Web Page</title>
	<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
	<link href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.5/js/bootstrap.min.jss" rel="text/javascript" />
	<link href="app.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

````

At this point nothing has changed on our page. Adding the Bootstrap files gave us access to the CSS classes that will define how our page gets laid out on different devices.

###Adding Containers
Bootstrap is based on having a container element to wrap all of the site contents and manage the rows that will lay out the 12 column grid system.

We are going to use the "container-fluid" class to make a full width container that will resize based on the size of the browser viewport.

Let's start by adding this class to our page \<header>.

````
<header class="container-fluid">
	<h1>Visit Anytown, USA!</h1>
</header>
````

Next, do the same around the main part of our web page including the both \<aside> and the \<section> tags that contain the bulk of the page content. Since we are working with three groups of tags, add a \<div> to wrap all of the page content not in the \<header> or \<footer>.

````
<div class="container-fluid">
	<nav>...</nav>
	<section>...</section>
	<aside>...</aside>
</div>
````

Finally, add the "container-fluid" class to the footer of your page.

````
<footer class="container-fluid">
	Copyright 2015
</footer>
````

Save and view your web page in a browser. Resize the width of your browser and see how the header and footer resize as well as the content in the page.

###Now for the Rows
Next, we want to move on the main content of our web page. Once we have our containers, we can create a row inside of that container. That row will be the basis for our twelve columns in our grid. Any time we are working with a row, we want to keep in mind that the number of columns should always add up to twelve.

In our example web page, we want to have the first list take up two columns, the main content to take the next eight columns and finally our second list to fill the final two columns.

First, change the \<nav> and \<aside> tags to have a class of "col-sm-3". This means on all devices small and up, create a space that is three grid columns wide.

````
<aside class="col-sm-3">
````
That will account for six of the columns in our grid, so now we want to change the main section of our content to have a class of "col-sm-6" to account for the other six columns.

````
<section class="col-sm-6">
````

Save and view your web page in a browser. Notice that the two lists we created now float to the right and left of our main content. What happens when you resize the window to a narrow screen similar to a phone? Notice that our content automatically reflows as necessary.

###More rows
Now that the content flows a little better when we resize the browser, let's take a closer look at our main content.
We're going to make the content of the articles look a little nicer. First lets add a \<div> with a class of "row" to the main section.

````
<section class="col-sm-6">
	<div class="row">
		<h2>Amazing Museums</h2>

	...

	</div>
</section>
````

What this will do is give us another 12 column row grid that we can begin to lay each article out. Let's make the image take up three columns and the paragraphs fit in the other nine columns.

````
<article>
	<h2>Amazing Museums</h2>
	<div class="col-sm-3">
		<img src="http://lorempixel.com/200/100/city/1" />
	</div>
	<div class="col-sm-9">
		<p>While most museums are a collection of old artifacts and stuff that no one is really interested in seeing, our musuems are the best of the best.</p>
		<p>You won't find anything like these any where else in the world. Our museums rival that of our closest competitors	including the Museum of Bad Art, the Paris Sewers Musuem and the Museum of Broken Relationships.</p>
		<p>Come check them out...the fun is waiting for you.</p>
	</div>
</article>

````

###What about content ordering
When the content reflows, things tend to jump around. The question you have to ask, is "What is the most important thing to be showing?" Currently, in a wide layout, our content is showing the main content between our two lists. When we resize the browser window to a narrow view, the main content is still between our two lists. What if we wanted to show our main content first? Let's do that now.

Move the \<section> tag and all of it's content above the first \<nav> content.

````
<section class="col-sm-6">...<\section>
<nav class="col-sm-3">
...
````

Save and reload the page in the narrow format. We got the look that we wanted. What about when we go back to the wide view? Things don't look the way we really want them now. The lists are both on the right side of the web page.
Thankfully, Bootstrap has a few extra classes that allow us to flow the content to where it needs to go. We put the content in the order that we want it to flow, then we use the Bootstrap classes to tweak the details. Let's look at the Bootstrap "push" and "pull" classes.
We will modify the main \<section> class by telling it to push three columns to the right.

````
<section class="col-sm-6 col-sm-push-3">...</section>
````

Next, modify the \<nav> class by telling it to "pull" six columns to the left.

````
<nav class="col-sm-3 col-sm-pull-6">...</nav>
````

Save and reload the page and look at the difference between the narrow width and the wide width browsers. Notice now the most important content is where it needs to be for each type of display.

###Push the changes to Azure
To close out this module, let's check in our changes and push them to Azure. You should already be set up for this from the previous modules, so if you haven't done the push to Azure before, you will need to back up and do that module first.
From a "Git Shell" prompt, we will do the following steps:

 1. Add all of the changed files to a checkin
	
	````
	git add .
	````
 2. Commit all of the changed files to your local repository

	````
	git commit -m "Added bootstrap styling"
	````
 3. Push all of the code changes to your Azure repository

	````
	git push azure master
	````

Now, navigate to your website at http://yourwebsite.azurewebsites.net and confirm that your code has been deployed.
