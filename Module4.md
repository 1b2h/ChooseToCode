###HTML and your Website
First, a little about this stuff we call HTML. This stands for Hypertext Markup Langauge and is basically a fancy way of saying how do we markup a text file to make it pretty on the web. It will seems like there is a lot to learn here, but think of it as learning how to use a word processor to make fancy documents.

###Create Simple Page
Now, let's get started with creating a place to put your new website. If you have completed the first three modules of this tutorial, you should have a machine set up with Visual Studio Code, Git and an account on Azure.

We are going to start at the Azure portal. With your browser, navigate to http://portal.azure.com. If you need to sign in, go ahead and do that now and you should arrive at the portal home page.

Now, in the upper left corner, click the plus sign or "New" button to create a new Azure resource.
